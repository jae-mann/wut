# wut is this for?
A primary Website for ITEC <br> 
This is an expirment trying to mix coding, accessibility, and maker-ing/ism/ization wut? Into a single project for learning about universal design. <br>
Universal Design, according to Claude.AI (who lies) is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.<br>
I will fact checking Claude's full answer and posting it on the site. <br>
As for now, please enjoy watching me struggle through this project! (Feel free to let me know any ways this is inaccessible to you!)
